## Development Workflow
- **ALWAYS** 
- when I say check in the code
- stash your changes
- pull latest 
- then commit and push

## Git & Version Control
- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Keep commits focused on single features or fixes
- Use pull requests for code reviews when working in teams
- Never commit sensitive data or API keys
